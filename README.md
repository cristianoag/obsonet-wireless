Repository to host source files for the Obsonet Wireless

The Obsonet Wireless is a cartridge for the MSX line of computers that implements a wireless network interface. It is based on the ESP8266 module and is compatible with the Obsonet cartridge.

The cartridge is based on a EP1C3T100C8 FPGA and the ESP8266 module. The FPGA is responsible for interfacing the ESP8266 module with the MSX bus and providing the necessary logic to implement the required functionality.

The UNAPI stack developed by Konamiman is used to provide the network interface to the MSX software. The ESP8266 firmware was developed by Oduvaldo Pavan Jr and adapted to the Obsonet Wireless by The Retro Hacker.

The Obsonet Wireless is a work in progress and is not yet available.
